There are 8.5 million pet dogs, living in a quarter of UK households. There are, however, times &amp;ndash; from office hours to holidays or family commitments &amp;ndash; when it is impossible to give a dog the walks and attention it needs. That is where a dog sitter or walker comes in.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Healthy dogs crave and need routine: continuity of care, environment, exercise and diet. Our pets merit more than a holding cell. The optimum care situation, be it just for a couple of hours or for a relatively long stay, is more akin to that of an extended family.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;No one knows that better than Joe Thomason, who set up the London-based Green Dog Walking three years ago. Mr Thomason, 25, now owns seven liveried vans, employs 15 uniformed staff and looks after about 200 dogs a day, with briefs that range from two-hour walks to overnight stays.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dogs need to be mentally stimulated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our clients rely on us every day,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;And they&amp;rsquo;re from all backgrounds. Most are just normal, hard-working people. Many prefer to use a service like ours rather than a more impersonal kennel because we are more like an extension of a dog&amp;rsquo;s immediate family, a club you sign on and stick with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Thomason adds: &amp;ldquo;A change of environment can unsettle a dog so we are at pains to replicate their routine and diet. When dogs board with us, either at our garden flat in Hampstead or with one of my employees who has similar outside space, it is generally a maximum of three or four per night. They can roam free in the living room, the bedroom or the hall &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s up to them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We only use cages if dogs are crated at home. It all depends on what they&amp;rsquo;re used to. And we encourage owners to bring blankets or bedding with them so their pets have a familiar smell. That way, they almost always settle after just one night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Thomason comes from a farming background in Kent, growing up with six Border collies. Working with dogs was a vocation. &amp;ldquo;Dogs are very therapeutic to be around &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re always happy, there&amp;rsquo;s always something new on a walk that will make you laugh and they all have such characters &amp;ndash; this job is almost like being a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s great exercise and a brilliant lifestyle but a huge responsibility too. With a dog service, the client doesn&amp;rsquo;t see what goes on. They have to be able to trust that the people&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/essentials/how-to-care-for-your-dog/&quot;&gt;caring for their dogs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are doing the right thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Healthy dogs crave and need routine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The daily routine is, despite being tailored to individual dogs, fairly regular. &amp;ldquo;It does vary slightly,&amp;rdquo; says Mr Thomason. &amp;ldquo;Working dogs like beagles or labrador retrievers need more exercise but all dogs need green spaces and exercise &amp;ndash; we give them all a proper walk. On average, one walk will last about an hour-and-a-half, roughly three miles.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If dogs are boarding with us, we feed them at 8am, or at whatever time they&amp;rsquo;re used to, then we let them out into the garden. We head out into the countryside at 9am. Our vans are fitted with crates.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We break for lunch for an hour, then we have group training and games in the afternoon. Dogs need to be mentally stimulated. Our daycare pets are dropped back at 5pm while the others head home with us for the night. It&amp;rsquo;s a structure that works.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;He adds: &amp;ldquo;We have permits to walk in the royal parks. We are fully insured and all have canine first-aid training. Any responsible company will have that &amp;ndash; but customers should always check.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Proud to be feeding generations of guide dogs&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This winter, Royal Canin will be donating &amp;pound;1 to Guide Dogs for every promotional bag of Breed diet sold in participating pet shops across the UK.*&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', 1, '2019-07-03 03:36:22', '2019-06-26 21:28:45'),

New Zealand has rules around dog ownership to protect our dogs and the general public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As a dog owner, you must:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;register your dog with your local council and get it microchipped&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;keep your dog under control at all times&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;ensure your dog is in good physical health and that you meet its natural behavioral needs&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;ensure your dog has food, water, and shelter.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Each local council has its own rules around looking after dogs. You may find more information under &amp;#39;Recreation&amp;#39; on our regional pages, or on your local council&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/regions-nz&quot;&gt;Regions &amp;amp; cities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the NZ Companion&amp;nbsp;Animal Council&amp;nbsp;estimated that caring&amp;nbsp;for a dog costs around $1,686&amp;nbsp;NZD a year. Make sure you are prepared to pay the costs before you decide to have a dog.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The cost of owning a dog can include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;registration and microchipping fees&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;food and shelter&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;vet care&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;daycare while you work or full-time care while you travel.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Registering and microchipping&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;All dogs over three months old must be microchipped. They must also be registered with the local council each year by 1 July. Owners of unregistered dogs can be fined.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;All dogs must wear the registration disc or strap provided when the dog is registered.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Any vet can assist with inserting a microchip. It is quite painless and permanently identifies the dog and its owner on the National Dog Database (NDD). Chips help dogs that are lost or stolen to be returned to their owners and enable councils to track dogs that have caused problems before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n', 1, '2019-07-03 03:36:24', '2019-06-27 03:14:32'),

They add a lot of responsibility. You have to bring them to the vet, feed them more than once a day, make sure they exercise, and of course, give them lots of love. Animals need so much care, but we love them enough for it not to bother us.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Dogs and cats are different, yes, but think about all the other animals that we can have as pets. Perhaps you prefer reptiles. Some people keep lizards or snakes as pets. Maybe even a little turtle! Fish also make an appearance in some households, as do rodents.
